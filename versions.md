## Sample Applications:
   - featureMonitor, silentHostDiscovery. Refer to [examples](examples) for more details. 
   
## Known Bugs:
   - Exception handling in GO. 
   - NxMacMgr events are generated only for MACs for which there is an AM adjacency.
   - NxMacMgr, NxAmMgr APIs works only in VSH Mode and not in BASH mode.
   - NxIntfMgr can only open around 3000 interfaces before memory limits are reached.
   
# NX-SDK v1.5.0:

## Nexus Release:

## Features: 
| Features  | Details |
| --- | --- |
|Languages | C++, Python |

| Advanced Exception | <ul><li>On failure, APIs throw exceptions. Refer to the API documentation for more details on the failures cases for each & every API.</li><li>In v1.0.0, failures are thrown as simple exceptions as Strings.</li><li>From v1.5.0, applications can either catch simple or advanced exceptions. Advanced exceptions are of common type "NxException" across all languages with more detailed information on the failure.</li><li>Refer to [nx_exception.h](include/nx_exception.h) for more details on the supported APIs & its usage.</li></ul>|
